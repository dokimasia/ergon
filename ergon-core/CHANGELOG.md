# go.dokimi.dev/ergon/core

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- b8f1c6a: Build, sign and attest the binaries of the commands of a Go module in each release of the module. The key binaries of the section go lists the commands. ergon init renders the configuration of GoReleaser of each module with a command. The job pack of release.yml builds the archives, the deb, rpm and apk packages, the casks, the checksums with their cosign signature and the SBOMs, and attests them. UPX packs each Linux binary with LZMA, and ergon tool run unpacks the .tar.xz of a release binary such as UPX. ergon release publish attaches the assets to a draft release before it publishes the release. ergon release ci homebrew then commits the casks to the tap of the key homebrew. The managed .gitignore ignores publish-plan.json and /dist/, so that Go writes the version of the release into each binary.
- 326b07e: Render nightly.yml, which runs the long steps of each language on a schedule, each step in a job of its own. The key nightly of the section go maps fuzz, bench and mutate to the limit of each job in minutes, and the key nightly.schedule of the section github states when the workflow runs.

### Patch Changes

- babadd5: Require Go 1.27.2, whose standard library fixes the nine vulnerabilities that govulncheck reports for Go 1.27.1, such as GO-2026-6604 of os.Root on Windows.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- c61862c: Add make generate, which runs the generators of every language, and the options generate.command and generate.args to every language section of .ergon.yaml. generate-<language> runs the generators, and verify-generate-<language>, the step generate of check, fails when they change a file. make help lists the targets in groups: Common, each language, and the targets of the repository.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 94c3bd1: Add ergon init upgrade and ergon init ci upgrade, which move a repository to the baseline of the newest release of ergon. The job of baseline.yml opens the pull request of the upgrade weekly, in place of an issue. ergon refuses a lock that a newer release of ergon wrote, and a local dependabot.yml that updates github-actions or pre-commit.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`afd76a1`](https://github.com/dokimasia/ergon/commit/afd76a177a970930daaf431bb6f6266b9c5028a3) Thanks [@stealth-rklopper](https://github.com/stealth-rklopper)! - Give each directory that license.directories lists a license of its own: the header of its files, and its LICENSE, with a NOTICE for Apache-2.0.
